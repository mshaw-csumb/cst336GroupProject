This will be the user story of our database. What we have so far:

The database is in use in a costume store, the users of this database system
will be able to see what type of costumes are in stock, and what accessories
come with them. There will be a table with accessories, a table of costumes,
and a table for which costumes go with what accessories. A typical user may 
want to see how many size small superman costumes are available for example.
Or they might want to see how many fake machetes come with the Jason Vorhes
Hocky Mask.
